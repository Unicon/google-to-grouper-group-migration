google-to-grouper-group-migration
=================================

This project provides a set of scripts that exports groups from Google Groups as JSON documents. The resulting output can then be massaged, if desired, and imported into Grouper. 

This code is very much "one and done", meaning they have not had extensive testing. Use them at your own risk.

> Unicon's work on these scripts was funded through a project with the University of Notre Dame.
